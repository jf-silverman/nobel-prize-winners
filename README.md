This short project is about conducting some light data preparation and exploratory data analysis in Python while learning about the history of nobel prize winners through time. I use a dataset from the Nobel Foundation to answer some questions about the countries, groups, and individuals that have won. This is a DataCamp.com project which I completed and saved to my github. You're welcome to visit my profile at https://www.datacamp.com/portfolio/mountaintr to see more of my courses, tracks and projects.
